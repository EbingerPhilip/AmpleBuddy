About AmpleBuddy

AmpleBuddy is designed to be a space where you can and chat with other empathetic users when you would like.
By having users classify themselves as either 'Green' or 'Red' (or even in-between !), AmpleBuddy creates an artificial support structure.

How does this work ? Through you !
Have you ever had days where you simply had to rant and get something off of your chest ? Well, there's a simple fix.
Log your mood as 'Red' today and be automatically matched with a Buddy to chat with. Just make sure you have Buddy Matching on in your profile !

On the other hand, have you just recovered from an emotional pit and want to help others back up ?
Or even, you simply feel very empathetic today and would like to help one of your fellow humans ?
Log your mood as 'Green' and just wait for you Buddy ! You can be the shoulder people cry on just like you dreamed !
